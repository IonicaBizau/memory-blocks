> The old Memory Blocks game (part of the Symantec Game Pack) ported to modern web.

## :memo: A Bit of History

2001 was the year when I first played a computer game. I was 6 year old.
It happened when we visited a friend in the neighboring village. I really enjoyed that game. That time there were just few people having computers.

The game I played was **Memory Blocks**. It is part of the *Symantec Game Pack*, coded by Charles Timmerman–founder of [Funster](http://funster.com) and author of over 90 puzzle books.

In the meantime I became a web developer and finally decided to port this game to WEB. Yes, you're looking at it and you can play it in your browser.

----

I contacted Charles Timmerman and showed him what I built. He was so happy to see his game alive on a modern platform:


> Amazing! That looks exactly my game!


> I like how the high score table looks the same and even the black & white option is preserved. In those days, there were Windows computers that were in black & white! You might be interested to know that I wrote all the games in assembly language- my choice in those days over the usual C.



I asked him to tell me more about the game history. He said:

> There wasn't very many games for Windows in 1991 when I
> created Memory Blocks and the other games in the
> Symantec Game Pack. I liked the idea of making
> cutting-edge computers play children's games that even
> our grandparents might be familiar with. It was a chance
> for the player to go back to childhood while still sitting
> in an office. (Windows computers were mainly for business
> in those days). I think these familiar games resonated
> with people and lead to their success.
