> The old Memory Blocks game (part of the Symantec Game Pack) ported to modern web.

## :memo: A Bit of History

2001 was the year when I first played a computer game. I was 6 year old.

It happened when we visited a friend in the neighboring village. I really enjoyed that game. That time there were just few people having computers.

The game I played was **Memory Blocks**. It is part of the *Symantec Game Pack*, coded by Charles Timmerman–founder of [Funster](http://funster.com) and author of over 90 puzzle books.

In the meantime I became a web developer and finally decided to port this game to WEB. Yes, you're looking at it and you can play it in your browser.

----

I contacted Charles Timmerman and showed him what I built. He was so happy to see his game alive on a modern platform:


> Amazing! That looks exactly my game!



> I like how the high score table looks the same and even the black & white option is preserved. In those days, there were Windows computers that were in black & white! You might be interested to know that I wrote all the games in assembly language- my choice in those days over the usual C.




I asked him to tell me more about the game history. He said:

> There wasn't very many games for Windows in 1991 when I
> created Memory Blocks and the other games in the
> Symantec Game Pack. I liked the idea of making
> cutting-edge computers play children's games that even
> our grandparents might be familiar with. It was a chance
> for the player to go back to childhood while still sitting
> in an office. (Windows computers were mainly for business
> in those days). I think these familiar games resonated
> with people and lead to their success.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`

Thanks! :heart:


## :cake: Thanks

 - Lots of thanks to [Charles Timmerman](http://funster.com/)–the

    Windows. He granted me permissions to use the game images and design in this
    clone. :cake:
 - Big thanks to [Antonija Šimić (**@tonkec**)](https://github.com/tonkec) for implementing the 3D animations. :sparkles:
